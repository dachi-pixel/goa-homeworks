    <main>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
        It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)<br>
          and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
         HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</main>
