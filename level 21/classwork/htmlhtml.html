    <main>When we give instructions to a computer through code, we are, in our own way, communicating with the computer.<br> But since computers are built differently than we are, we have to 
        translate our instructions in a way that computers will understand
        Computers interpret instructions in a very literal manner, so we have to be very<br> specific in how we program them. Think about 
        instructing someone to walk.<br> If you start by telling them, “Put your foot in front of yourself,” do they 
        know what a foot is? Or what front means?<br> and now we understand why it’s taken so long to develop bipedal robots. 
        In coding, that could mean makin sure that small things like punctuation and spelling are correct.<br> Many tears have 
        been shed over a missing semicolon (;) a symbol that a lot of programming languages use to denote the end of a line</main>

        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic.<br>
         Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,<br>
          make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,<br>
           as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing component,<br>
            Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.<br>
             Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.<br>
              The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all<br>
               major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</article></center>
