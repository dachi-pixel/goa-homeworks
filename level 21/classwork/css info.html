    <main>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document<br>
         written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1]<br>
          CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]<br>
         This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation;<br>
          provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages<br>
           to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition<br>
            in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages<br>
             that share the file and its formatting</main>
