    <p>When we give instructions to a computer through code, we are, in our own way, communicating with the computer.<br> But since computers are built differently than we are, we have to 
        translate our instructions in a way that computers will understand</p>
    <p>Computers interpret instructions in a very literal manner, so we have to be very<br> specific in how we program them. Think about 
        instructing someone to walk.<br> If you start by telling them, “Put your foot in front of yourself,” do they 
        know what a foot is? Or what front means?<br> and now we understand why it’s taken so long to develop bipedal robots. 
        In coding, that could mean makin sure that small things like punctuation and spelling are correct.<br> Many tears have 
        been shed over a missing semicolon (;) a symbol that a lot of programming languages use to denote the end of a line</p>
